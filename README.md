## Make Change Project

This software product is designed to assist employees/cashiers, with returning
proper change back to the customers. In the future it may be linked to a
database for monitoring and accountability of all dollar bills and coins that
are passed to a customer throughout daily transactions.

#### First week homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This program has been written to eliminate the possibility of loss through
confusion, illiteracy, language barriers or theft, during daily transactions,
providing accountability during day to day business.

### How to run
1) Compile the Java code.  
2) Execute the Java code.  
3) At the prompt, type in the total of the purchase.
4) The program determines change due. It then breaks down change due to the
customer, by each individual dollar bill and coin due back to the customer.

### Technologies/topics used
This program utilizes the calling of Java methods holding 'switch' statements
for organizational value and 'if' statements for utilizing doubles.  
It changes from a 'switch', used to determine dollar bill returned, to
'if' statements that are used to determine coins returned.  
This becomes necessary because 'switch' statements utilize integers and
are unable to process doubles.  For that function, this program incorporates
'if' statements to evaluate coin returns.

### Lessons
Lessons learned specifically align with calling of methods in Java
Making sure that the method is returning a integer or double properly
that the other methods can accurately utilize that information as they
are referred to and utilized by the main method.
